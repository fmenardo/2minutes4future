# Data


## Temperature

### 1850 AD - present

Data from 1850 onward was obtained from HadCRUT4 (https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut4/). HadCRUT4 is a gridded dataset of global historical surface temperature anomalies relative to a 1961-1990 reference period. Data are available for each month since January 1850, on a 5 degree grid.

### 11,300 BC - 1850 AD

The estimates of the temperature anomaly in the Holocene was obtained from Marcott et al. 2013

*"This study includes 73 records derived from multiple paleoclimate archive sand temperature proxies(Fig. S1; Table S1): alkenone (n=31), planktonic foraminifera Mg/Ca (n=19), TEX86 (n=4), fossil chironomid transfer function (n=4),fossil pollen modern analog technique (MAT) (n=4), ice-core stable isotopes (n=5), other microfossil assemblages(MATand Transfer Function)(n=5), and Methylation index of Branched Tetraethers(MBT)(n=1) \[...\] The 73 globally distributed temperature records used in our analysis are based on a variety of paleotemperature proxies and have sampling resolutions ranging from 20 to 500 years,with a median resolution of 120 years"*.

An important limitation of this data is that it does not fully resolve variability at periods shorter than 2000 years, with essentially no variability preserved at periods shorter than 300 years, ~50% preserved at 1000-year periods,and nearly all of the variability preserved for periods longer than 2000 years

## Atmospheric CO2 concentration

### 1959 AD - present

Data from 1959 through 1979 have been obtained by C. David Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and were obtained from the Scripps website (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu). Data from 1980 onwards is sourced from NOAA's Mauna Loa monitoring station

### ~800,000 BC - 1959 AD

Long-term data were compiled by Our world in data: data from ice cores – specifically the Dome C core – has been made available from the NOAA here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/17975. In this original dataset, some years had multiple measurements (taken at different points of the year). To normalize this to a single year, where several measurements were available, we took the average of these concentration values. Dome C data has been used until the year 1958.
